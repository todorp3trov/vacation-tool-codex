# Executive Summary

## Project Name
**Vacation Tool**

## Vision Statement
Vacation Tool is a lightweight, web-based vacation management application that replaces paper-based workflows with a transparent, role-based system. Employees can see and request vacation days via an intuitive calendar, managers can review and approve requests in context of team schedules, and HR can reliably process only manager-approved requests—all powered by integrations with external systems for national holidays and vacation balances.

## Problem Statement
Many companies still rely on paper or ad hoc processes for vacation requests, making it difficult for managers and employees to track who is off when and how many vacation days remain. Requests get lost, visibility is low, and HR must manually reconcile decisions with separate systems. This creates confusion, errors in vacation balances, and inefficiencies across employees, managers, and HR.

## Target Outcome
Success for Vacation Tool v1 means that employees of a company can log in via a simple web app, clearly see their remaining vacation days and team calendar, submit requests that comply with basic rules (balance and notice), and have those requests seamlessly routed to managers and then to HR. Managers can make decisions quickly from a calendar view, HR can mark approved requests as processed, and the system stays in sync with external sources for national holidays and vacation balances without manual recalculation.
